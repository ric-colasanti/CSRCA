<h1>Real communities of virtual plants explain plant biodiversity on
    just three assumptions</h1>
<p>Roderick Hunt, Ricardo L. Colasanti<p>
<p>Working with two-dimensional cellular automata which represent a range of
previously validated plant functional types, and employing a scale far beyond that of
even the most ambitious investigations in the real world, we succeed in sustaining
realistic, very long-term, patterns of plant biodiversity by manipulating the levels of,
and degree of heterogeneity in the supply of, resources, external disturbances and
invading propagules. We fail to reproduce such phenomena when we adopt the
assumptions of unified neutral theory. We conclude that although further, and
possibly more complex, sets of processes could also lead to the long-term
maintenance of plant biodiversity, (i) the differentiation of plant life into distinct
functional types, (ii) the presence of environmental heterogeneity, and (iii) the
opportunity for invasion all appear to be necessary simultaneously. We consider it
unlikely that any combination of conditions more minimal than the set demonstrated
here would be sufficient to deliver the same result.</p>
